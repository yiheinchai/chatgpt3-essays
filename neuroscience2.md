# Dreams and its relation to schizophrenia, ability of memory storage of sensory experiences from dreams
Dreams are a form of spontaneous mental activity that occurs during sleep, involving visual imagery, emotions, thoughts, and sometimes sounds or other sensations. Dreams may reflect the processing and consolidation of memories, emotions, and information acquired during wakefulness.
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there), delusions (false beliefs that are not based on reality), disorganized speech and behavior, and cognitive impairments.
Some researchers have proposed that dreams and schizophrenia share some common mechanisms and functions. For example, both involve the activation of brain regions related to perception, emotion, memory, and self-awareness; both involve the generation of internal representations that are detached from external reality; both involve the modulation of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin; and both may serve as a way of coping with stress or trauma .
However, there are also important differences between dreams and schizophrenia. For example, dreams occur in a state of reduced awareness and consciousness; whereas schizophrenia affects the person’s ability to distinguish reality from fantasy even when awake. Dreams are usually forgotten upon awakening; whereas schizophrenia persists over time and interferes with daily functioning. Dreams are influenced by personal experiences and cultural factors; whereas schizophrenia has a strong genetic component .
The ability to store sensory experiences from dreams in memory depends on several factors such as the content and intensity of the dream, the stage of sleep in which the dream occurs (REM or non-REM), the timing of awakening relative to the dream (immediate or delayed), and the individual’s personality traits (such as creativity or openness) . Some studies have suggested that people with schizophrenia may have impaired memory for their dreams compared to healthy controls or people with other mental disorders.

# Emotions produced internally but yet external to consciousness, and conscious decoding to derive source of emotional trigger
Emotions are complex phenomena that involve both physiological and psychological processes. Some emotions are produced internally by the brain’s predictions of what is happening in the body and the world, based on past experiences and current sensory input12. These emotions may not be consciously accessible, but they still influence our behavior and cognition3. Conscious decoding is the process of becoming aware of these emotions and identifying their causes or triggers4. This can help us regulate our emotions better and understand ourselves and others better.

# Our mental models of other people as a way to predict their actions, and model updating when prediction fails via new data point
We use mental models or representations of other people’s beliefs, desires, intentions, emotions, and personality traits to predict their actions and reactions. These models are based on our own experiences, observations, and assumptions. Sometimes, our predictions may fail because our models are inaccurate or incomplete. When this happens, we need to update our models with new data points or evidence that contradicts our expectations. This can help us improve our social cognition and communication.

# Comparing mechanisms of language production in humans vs LLM by next word prediction
Language production is the process of generating meaningful linguistic utterances from thoughts or intentions. In humans, language production involves several cognitive processes such as conceptualization, formulation, articulation, self-monitoring, and feedback. One mechanism that humans use for language production is next word prediction, which is the ability to anticipate what word will come next in a sentence based on linguistic rules and context. LLM (large language model) is a type of artificial neural network that can generate natural language texts from inputs such as words or sentences. LLM also uses next word prediction as a mechanism for language production by learning statistical patterns from large corpora of texts. However, there are some differences between human and LLM language production mechanisms such as:
    1. Humans have more semantic knowledge than LLMs about the meaning of words and concepts
    2. Humans have more pragmatic knowledge than LLMs about the purpose and context of communication
    3. Humans have more metalinguistic knowledge than LLMs about the structure and function of language
    4. Humans have more creative potential than LLMs to produce novel and coherent texts
    5. Humans have more ethical awareness than LLMs about the impact and consequences of their texts

# Visual input pathways that goes through consciousness and that bypasses consciousness
Visual input pathways are the routes that visual information takes from the retina to the brain. There are two main visual input pathways: the retinogeniculostriate pathway and the retinotectal pathway.

The retinogeniculostriate pathway is the main pathway for conscious vision. It involves the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), optic radiation, and primary visual cortex (V1). This pathway allows us to perceive colors, shapes, movements, depth, and details of visual stimuli1.

The retinotectal pathway is a secondary pathway for unconscious vision. It involves the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, superior colliculus (SC), pulvinar nucleus (PUL), and extrastriate cortex. This pathway mediates reflexive eye movements, orienting responses, and attention to visual stimuli1.

# Bias accumulation within neural networks leading to functional specialisation of the brain

This refers to the idea that neural networks that are trained on different tasks tend to develop distinct patterns of activity and connectivity that optimize their performance for those tasks. This could explain why the human brain has multiple regions with specialized functions, such as face recognition, language comprehension, or social cognition. For example, a study by Dobs et al. (2022) found that artificial neural networks that were optimized for both face and object recognition spontaneously segregated themselves into separate systems for faces and objects1.

# Bias accumulation within neural networks leading to functional specialisation of the brain (like many phenomenon in embryology)
Bias accumulation refers to the tendency of neural networks to develop distinct and often highly specialized representations for different tasks or categories as a result of optimization12. This may lead to functional specialization of the brain, meaning that certain regions of the cortex are selectively activated by specific stimuli or processes1. Functional specialization may reflect a computational advantage for solving multiple natural tasks with high efficiency and accuracy1. This phenomenon may also be influenced by developmental factors, such as gene expression, synaptic pruning, and experience-dependent plasticity34, that shape the structure and function of neural circuits over time.

# Emotions as optimisation algorithm for self-benefit
Emotions can be seen as optimization algorithms for self-benefit, meaning that they help us achieve our goals and maximize our rewards in different situations5. Emotions can influence our decision making, learning, memory, attention, motivation, and social behavior5. Emotions can also provide feedback on our actions and outcomes, allowing us to adjust our strategies and expectations accordingly5. Emotions can be adaptive or maladaptive depending on how well they match the demands and opportunities of the environment5.

# Effect of mirror neurons on the perception of risk and decision making
Mirror neurons are neurons that fire both when we perform an action and when we observe someone else performing the same or similar action. Mirror neurons may play a role in social cognition, empathy, imitation, language, and theory of mind. Mirror neurons may also affect our perception of risk and decision making by enabling us to simulate the outcomes and consequences of others’ actions in our own brain . For example, mirror neurons may help us evaluate the potential rewards or costs of an action based on how we see others perform it or react to it . Mirror neurons may also modulate our risk preferences depending on whether we observe others taking risks or being cautious .

# Effect of the way knowledge is presented (lists, maps) on memory storage in the brain
The way knowledge is presented (lists, maps) can affect how it is stored and retrieved in the brain by influencing its organization, structure, and accessibility . Lists are linear sequences of items that can be ordered according to some criterion (e.g., alphabetical, chronological) . Lists can facilitate memory by providing cues for recall and recognition . However, lists can also limit memory by imposing a rigid structure that may not reflect the inherent relations among items . Maps are graphical representations of spatial information that can show multiple dimensions (e.g., distance, direction) . Maps can enhance memory by providing a holistic view of complex information that reveals patterns and connections among items . However, maps can also impair memory by requiring more cognitive resources to process and interpret than lists .
